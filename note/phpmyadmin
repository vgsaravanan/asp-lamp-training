Install phpMyAdmin

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

The installation process actually adds the phpMyAdmin Apache configuration file into the /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/ directory, where it is automatically read.

The only thing we need to do is explicitly enable the php5-mcrypt extension, which we can do by typing:

sudo php5enmod mcrypt

restart Apache

sudo service apache2 restart
