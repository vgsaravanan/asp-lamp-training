“Hi I am saravanan and hails from KPM. I did my B.Tech in Information Technology from 
SVCE, which is under Anna University. I have 5 members in my family and I am the youngest son. I love outdoor sports.”

First of all, many thanks for calling me and giving me this golden opportunity to introduce myself in front of you. Myself saravanan from KPM, born and brought-up in this great city

“As a fresher, I am assuming by first five years will be a huge learning curve. I want to absorb much of the industry knowledge and also to sharpen my technical abilities. In next five years I see myself playing various roles in the team from a developer to leading a team.”

“I consider my first job as an extension of my studies only. More like a practical class. I want to learn a lot of new technologies, learn how the corporate world works, be part of a big energetic team and contribute to the projects, develop my soft skills and to prepare myself for tougher challenges in future.”

I have had lot of studies during all these years, but mostly theoretical leanings. My first & foremost expectation from my first job would be to learn how all these are applied in a practical and industrial way. I also want to be a part of the corporate culture and learn how this is run.

“I tend to say Yes, when someone asks for help. I am working on learning to say No at times”.
