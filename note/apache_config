Restarting Apache : 
Debian and Ubuntu:

sudo service apache2 restart

Fedora and CentOS:

sudo service httpd restart

    You can use one of the following three commands instead, depending on your Linux distribution:


    /etc/init.d/httpd restart

    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

    /etc/rc.d/httpd restart


Reloading Apache:

Debian and Ubuntu:
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Fedora and CentOS:
/etc/init.d/httpd reload

Enabling Verbose Logs

Sometimes it can be helpful to see extra information from Apache. You can increase the amount of detail shown in the logs by changing the log level.

    Open your Apache configuration file for editing. The Fedora and CentOS configuration file should be located at /etc/httpd/httpd.conf. This example shows the location of the Debian and Ubuntu configuration file:

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    Locate the LogLevel variable, and update it from the default warn to info or debug. debug will produce the greatest amount of output.

    /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

        # LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
        # alert, emerg.
        # 
        LogLevel debug

    Restart Apache:

    sudo service apache2 restart

    Perform the operation that was giving you trouble, then check the logs for more detailed information and errors.
