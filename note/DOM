Insertion and removal of nodes:

    From the parent:
        parent.appendChild(node)
        parent.insertBefore(node, nextSibling)
        parent.removeChild(node)
        parent.replaceChild(newElem, node)

    All these methods return node.

    Given a list of nodes and strings:
        node.append(...nodes or strings) – insert into node, at the end,
        node.prepend(...nodes or strings) – insert into node, at the beginning,
        node.before(...nodes or strings) –- insert right before node,
        node.after(...nodes or strings) –- insert right after node,
        node.replaceWith(...nodes or strings) –- replace node.
        node.remove() –- remove the node.

    Text strings are inserted “as text”.

    Given a piece of HTML: elem.insertAdjacentHTML(where, html), inserts depending on where:
        "beforebegin" – insert html right before elem,
        "afterbegin" – insert html into elem, at the beginning,
        "beforeend" – insert html into elem, at the end,
        "afterend" – insert html right after elem.

    Also there are similar methods elem.insertAdjacentText and elem.insertAdjacentElement, they insert text strings and elements, but they are rarely used.

    To append HTML to the page before it has finished loading:
        document.write(html)

    After the page is loaded such call erases the document. Mostly seen in old scripts.
